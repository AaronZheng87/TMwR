# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This file contains what you need to know to help. 

If you have a contribution, please fork the repo and make a pull request (PR). 

If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to the authors listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file".

__If you find a bug__, please make an issue or pull request. Since all of the data and code are available, we will require minimal reprex (reproducible example). The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that we can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading "[What is a reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex#what-is-a-reprex)", and follow the advice further down that page. 

Formatting

 * All code chunks have labels that are concise but descriptive. They should also make good figure names. Look at each chapter's chunk names; we keep a common prefix for each chapter. Names should used `-` to space words.
 
 * Figures should have transparent backgrounds and legends (if any) on top.
 
 * Please use US spellings (e.g. "color" instead of "colour"). 
 
 * Do not break lines within sentences or paragraphs. 
 
 * Adhere as best as possible to the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). 
 
 * Please avoid adding new pacakge dependencies. If that can't be avoided, add them to the DESCRIPTION file.
