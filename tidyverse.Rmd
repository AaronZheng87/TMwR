## Principles

What does it mean to be "tidy" (distinguish tidy data vs tidy interfaces etc. )


## Code

Things that I think that we'll need summaries of:

 * strategies: variable specification, pipes (with data or other first arguments), conflicts and using namespaces, splicing, non-standard evaluation, 

 * tactics: `select`, `bind_cols`, `tidyselect`, `slice`,  `!!` and `!!!`, `...` for passing arguments, tibbles, joins, `nest`/`unnest`, `group_by`


## Modeling via base R

white book turning point

base R conventions, basic usage, etc.
