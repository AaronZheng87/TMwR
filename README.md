# TMwR

<!-- badges: start -->

This repository has the sources for _Tidy Modeling with R_ book. Its purpose of the book is to demonstrate how the tidyverse can be used to produce high quality models. The [_tidymodels packages_](https://github.com/tidymodels) are the focus of the book. 

# Reproducing the book or results

First, you'll need to install the required packages. To do this, first install the `remotes` package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

then use this to install what you need to create the book: 

``` r
remotes::install_github("topepo/TMwR")
```

Although we rigorously try to use the current CRAN versions of all packages, the code above may install some development versions.
