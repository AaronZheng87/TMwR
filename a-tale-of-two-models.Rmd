# A tale of two models  {#two-models}

(tentative title)

Perhaps show an example of a predictive model and contrast it with another that is inferential. 

Chicago data from FES: one predictive model and one to test if there is a difference in ridership with the Bears are at home. what do we care about for each? how accurate is the inferential model? Perhaps look at the [`tscount`](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v082i05) package to deal with the autoregressive potential.
